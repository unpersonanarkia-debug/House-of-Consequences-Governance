Constitutional Article I: Canonical Integration
Preamble  
This Article establishes the canonical foundation of the House of Consequences Governance product.  
It defines the inseparable relationship between the Canonical Casebook and the product architecture, ensuring conceptual integrity, operational validity, and ownership continuity.
Section 1. Ontological Unity  
The Canonical Casebook shall not exist apart from the House of Consequences Governance product.  
It is not a method, document, or framework, but a constitutional component that defines the product’s lawful and structural identity.
Section 2. Constitutional Function  
Within the product, the Canonical Casebook functions as the internal constitution that governs permissible use, structural integrity, and epistemic boundaries.  
No configuration, client request, or derivative may override, remove, or reinterpret canonical constraints.
Section 3. Validation Principle  
Every decision, case, or lifecycle instance must be validated against the Canonical Casebook schema, structure, and terminology.  
Failure to conform shall result in automatic denial of canonical status within the governance system.
Section 4. Commercial Indivisibility  
The Canonical Casebook is not licensable, sublicensable, or transferable as a standalone asset.  
It remains an intrinsic part of the House of Consequences Governance product, inseparable in code, concept, and distribution.
Section 5. Proof of Ownership  
Proof of canonical authorship and ownership resides exclusively in the functional implementation of the governance product and its verifiable repository lineage.  
Statements, documents, or external reproductions hold no canonical force without the operational product.
Clause of Finality  
Only the authentic and verifiable House of Consequences Governance implementation shall be recognized as the canonical execution of this Article.
