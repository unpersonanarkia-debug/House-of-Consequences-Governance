# Governance Constitution  
House of Consequences Governance

## Purpose

This document defines the immutable governance principles of the House of Consequences Governance system.

It exists to:
- prevent misuse, capture, or narrative manipulation
- enforce structural integrity across all implementations
- ensure long-term analytical credibility

This constitution applies to all:
- casebooks
- schemas
- visualizations
- APIs
- commercial deployments


## Foundational Principle

House of Consequences Governance does not evaluate people, intentions, or moral worth.

It evaluates *decision structures and their consequences over time*.

If a contribution attempts to:
- personalize blame
- construct advocacy narratives
- obscure decision chains

→ it is structurally invalid.


## Non-Negotiable Structural Rules

### 1. Decision-Centric Analysis Only

All cases must be modeled as decision lifecycles:

- trigger
- interpretation
- decision
- immediate consequence
- recursive effect
- normalized state

No case may skip, merge, or redefine these stages.


### 2. No Real-Time Adjudication

The system must not be used for:
- live decision-making
- operational enforcement
- individual case handling

This is a *retrospective structural analysis framework* only.


### 3. Aggregation Requirement

All casebooks must:
- be aggregated
- avoid identifying individuals
- operate at organizational or systemic level

Violation of this rule invalidates canonical status.


### 4. Normalized State Is Mandatory

Every case must define a *normalized state*.

If no normalized state exists:
- the case is incomplete
- the analysis is rejected

The system exists to expose what becomes “normal.”


### 5. Canonical Compatibility

All casebooks must validate against the locked canonical schema.

Compatibility is:
- technical (schema validation)
- semantic (conceptual alignment)
- structural (lifecycle completeness)


## Anti-Propaganda Safeguards

The architecture explicitly forbids:

- persuasive framing
- emotive escalation
- selective omission
- moral shortcuts

If a case attempts to tell the reader *what to think*, rather than *what followed*, it is invalid.


## Resistance to Capture

This governance model is designed to withstand:

- state pressure
- corporate incentives
- ideological appropriation
- reputational laundering

It achieves this by:
- removing moral judgment hooks
- refusing real-time authority
- locking analytical primitives


## Amendment Policy

This constitution may only be amended if:
- the canonical schema version is incremented
- backward compatibility impact is documented
- Canonical Casebook #0 remains valid

No amendment may invalidate the foundational case.


## Final Clause

House of Consequences Governance exists to make the invisible visible.

If a system fears this mirror,  
that fear is itself a consequence.
