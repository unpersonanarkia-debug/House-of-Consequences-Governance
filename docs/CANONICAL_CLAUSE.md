# Canonical Clause  
Ownership, Validity, and Use

## Definition of “Canonical”

Within this project, the term *Canonical* is a formally defined construct.

“Canonical” refers exclusively to:
- Canonical Casebooks
- Canonical Schemas
- Canonical Validation Logic

as defined and distributed as part of the *House of Consequences Governance* product.

The term is not descriptive.
It is *constitutive*.


## Three-Lock Ownership Model

Canonical status exists only when *all three locks* are satisfied.

### 🔑 Lock 1 — Structural Lock

The case or schema must:
- conform exactly to the official canonical schema
- pass validation without modification
- preserve required fields and semantics

Structural similarity is insufficient.


### 🔑 Lock 2 — Cryptographic / Technical Lock

Canonical materials must:
- originate from the official repository or distribution channel
- retain version identifiers and integrity markers
- be verifiable against the authoritative source

Unverifiable copies are non-canonical by definition.


### 🔑 Lock 3 — Product Binding Lock

Canonical materials are inseparable from:
*House of Consequences Governance* as a product.

Canonical status requires:
- reference to the official product
- use within the governance engine
- acknowledgment of the canonical clause

Detached use voids canonical standing.


## Consequences of Missing a Lock

If *any one lock* is missing:

- the material may exist
- it may be inspired
- it may be compatible

…but it is *not canonical*.

Claims of canonical ownership without all three locks constitute misrepresentation.


## Commercial and Legal Use

- Canonical materials may not be used in competing products without license.
- “Canonical Casebook” may not be claimed as a generic category.
- Reverse engineering of validation logic is prohibited.

Open-source components may exist around the core,  
but the canonical core remains protected.


## Purpose of This Clause

This clause exists to:
- protect analytical integrity
- prevent narrative hijacking
- ensure long-term trust in the system

It does not restrict thought.
It restricts *false authority*.


## Final Statement

Canonical authority is not claimed.
It is proven.

Without all three keys,
the door does not open.
