Article I — Canonical Integration
1. Principle of Unity  
The Canonical Casebook exists solely within the House of Consequences Governance product. It is not distributed, licensed, or recognized as a standalone framework, method, or document.
2. Constitutional Function  
The Canonical Casebook serves as the product’s internal constitution. It defines the governing rules of structural integrity, lifecycle validation, and epistemic limits. No configuration, client request, or derivative may override its canonical provisions.
3. Validation Requirement  
Every registered case, decision lifecycle, or outcome visualization is validated exclusively against the canonical schema and terminology. Nonconforming data or representations hold no canonical status.
4. Commercial Indivisibility  
The Canonical Casebook is not separable, licensable, or transferable independently. All canonical implementations are inherently bound to the House of Consequences Governance product and its verified repositories.
5. Proof of Canonical Ownership  
Ownership of the canonical structure resides exclusively in the verifiable implementation and repository lineage of this product. External documents or claims without repository verification are non‑canonical.

Canonical Casebook is not a framework, method, or standalone specification.
It is an integral, non-separable constitutional component of the House of Consequences Governance product.
Any implementation, reference, or derivative lacking this product cannot claim canonical status.

Clause of Finality  
Only the operational and verifiable instance of House of Consequences Governance constitutes the canonical execution of this Constitution.

Signature and Verification  
Repository origin and version signatures serve as proof of authenticity.
