# House of Consequences Governance

House of Consequences Governance is an analysis and learning framework designed to make visible how decisions accumulate into predictable consequences within organizations and societies.

This is not a reporting system.  
This is not case-by-case adjudication.  

👉 This is a mirror for the system itself.


## What This Is

House of Consequences Governance visualizes how recurring decisions form structural pathways that lead to measurable — and often normalized — outcomes, far removed from the original decision point.

The system is built around a *casebook model*:

- one organization / instance at a time  
- one clearly bounded theme at a time  
- historical and aggregated perspective  
- focus on decisions and processes  

Not individuals.  
Not real-time monitoring.  
Not blame attribution.


## The House of Consequences Decision Lifecycle

All casebooks follow the same locked decision lifecycle:

1. *Trigger*  
   – an observed phenomenon, deviation, or crisis

2. *Interpretation*  
   – framing, explanation, or sense-making model

3. *Decision*  
   – an action taken (or consciously not taken)

4. *Immediate Consequence*  
   – the direct outcome of the decision

5. *Recursive Effect*  
   – compounding, delayed, or side effects

6. *Normalized State*  
   – a new normal in which the consequence ceases to be treated as an exception

👉 The model does not judge moral intent.  
👉 The model shows *what follows*.


## Canonical Casebook

At the core of this product is the *Canonical Casebook*.

The Canonical Casebook is:
- a locked reference framework  
- a formal schema  
- a shared analytical language for consequences

The Canonical Casebook is not:
- an opinion  
- a narrative  
- a single study or report  

All casebooks must validate against the official schema.  
If content does not fit the schema, it *does not belong* in the casebook.


## Canonical Casebook #0 – Normalized Error

The first canonical case is an abstract foundational case:

*Canonical Casebook #0: “Normalized Error”*

It describes a system in which:
- errors are no longer exceptions  
- errors have no accountable origin  
- consequences become permanent states  
- irresponsibility becomes institutionalized  

This case functions as:
- the baseline reference for all other casebooks  
- a diagnostic for structural non-learning  
- the ethical and analytical zero-point of the model
