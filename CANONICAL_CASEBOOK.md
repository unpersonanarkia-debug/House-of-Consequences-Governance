# Canonical Casebook v1.0 
## Official Release Statement

### Status
Released · Binding · Constitutional

### Authority
House of Consequences Governance

This document is normative, not descriptive.

Canonical Casebook v1.0 is hereby released as the foundational and inseparable constitutional core of House of Consequences Governance.

This release establishes the first authoritative definition of a canonical casebook:
a governance-validated, lifecycle-complete, and structurally constrained representation of systemic decision consequences.

Canonical Casebook v1.0:
• exists only within House of Consequences Governance,
• derives its validity exclusively from the product’s governance engine,
• and cannot be meaningfully interpreted, replicated, or designated as canonical outside this system.

Any external casebook, schema, or implementation — regardless of structural similarity — does not constitute a Canonical Casebook unless processed and validated by House of Consequences Governance.

This release marks the point at which canonical governance becomes a functional system, not a theoretical model.
